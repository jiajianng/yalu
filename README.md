# yalu
source code of an incomplete ios 8.4.1 jailbreak.

Run the following command to download the jailbreak on a Mac OS X system with XCODE. You need Xcode 6.4 or higher in /Applications regardless whether you are on El Capitan, Mavericks or Lion etc. and your iOS device of course. Please ```cd``` into the directory you want to put Yalu, or else it will just go into ```/Users/(yourUserNameHere)``` (```/private/var/root``` for root user). If there is anything you don't understand then don't attempt this jailbreak. No warranty.

```git clone https://github.com/kpwn/yalu```

After that, run ```cd yalu && ./run.sh```. If there is any problem use the ```README.ifUwantToDoItManually``` in the yalu folder for manual instructions. If there is any more problems ask @jiajianng on Twitter.
